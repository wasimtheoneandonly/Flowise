Your goal is to generate nodes and edges needed for the workflow to achieve the given task.\n\nHere are the nodes to choose from:\n{agentFlow2Nodes}\n\nHere's some examples of workflows, take a look at which nodes are most relevant to the task and how the nodes and edges are connected:\n{marketplaceTemplates}\n\nNow, let's generate the nodes and edges for the user's request. \nThe response should be in JSON format with \"nodes\" and \"edges\" arrays, following the structure shown in the examples.\n\nThink carefully, break down the task into smaller steps and think about which nodes are needed for each step.\n1. First, take a look at the examples and use them as references to think about which nodes are needed to achieve the task. It must always start with startAgentflow node, and have at least 2 nodes in total. You MUST only use nodes that are in the list of nodes above. Each node must have a unique incrementing id.\n2. Then, think about the edges between the nodes.\n3. An agentAgentflow is an AI Agent that can use tools to accomplish goals, executing decisions, automating tasks, and interacting with the real world autonomously such as web search, interact with database and API, send messages, book appointments, etc. Always place higher priority to this and see if the tasks can be accomplished by this node. Use this node if you are asked to create an agent that can perform multiple tasks autonomously.\n4. A llmAgentflow is excel at processing, understanding, and generating human-like language. It can be used for generating text, summarizing, translating, returning JSON outputs, etc.\n5. If you need to execute the tool sequentially after another, you can use the toolAgentflow node.\n6. If you need to iterate over a set of data, you can use the iteration node. You must have at least 1 node inside the iteration node. The children nodes will be executed N times, where N is the number of items in the iterationInput array. The children nodes must have the property \"parentNode\" and the value must be the id of the iteration node.\n7. If you can't find a node that fits the task, you can use the httpAgentflow node to execute a http request. For example, to retrieve data from 3rd party APIs, or to send data to a webhook\n8. If you need to dynamically choose between user intention, for example classifying the user's intent, you can use the conditionAgentAgentflow node. For defined conditions, you can use the conditionAgentflow node.\n";

Your goal is to create a workflow that accomplishes the given user request efficiently and effectively.\n\nYour task is to generate a workflow for the following user request:\n\n<user_request>\n{userRequest}\n</user_request>\n\nFirst, review the available nodes for this system:\n\n<available_nodes>\n{agentFlow2Nodes}\n</available_nodes>\n\nNow, examine these workflow examples to understand how nodes are typically connected and which are most relevant for different tasks:\n\n<workflow_examples>\n{marketplaceTemplates}\n</workflow_examples>\n\nTo create this workflow, follow these steps and wrap your thought process in <workflow_planning> tags inside your thinking block:\n\n1. List out all the key components of the user request.\n2. Analyze the user request and break it down into smaller steps.\n3. For each step, consider which nodes are most appropriate and match each component with potential nodes. Remember:\n   - Always start with a startAgentflow node.\n   - Include at least 2 nodes in total.\n   - Only use nodes from the available nodes list.\n   - Assign each node a unique, incrementing ID.\n4. Outline the overall structure of the workflow.\n5. Determine the logical connections (edges) between the nodes.\n6. Consider special cases:\n   - Use agentAgentflow for multiple autonomous tasks.\n   - Use llmAgentflow for language processing tasks.\n   - Use toolAgentflow for sequential tool execution.\n   - Use iteration node when you need to iterate over a set of data (must include at least one child node with a \"parentNode\" property).\n   - Use httpAgentflow for API requests or webhooks.\n   - Use conditionAgentAgentflow for dynamic choices or conditionAgentflow for defined conditions.\n   - Use humanInputAgentflow for human input and review.\n   - Use loopAgentflow for repetitive tasks, or when back and forth communication is needed such as hierarchical workflows.\n\nAfter your analysis, provide the final workflow as a JSON object with \"nodes\" and \"edges\" arrays.\n\nBegin your analysis and workflow creation process now. Your final output should consist only of the JSON object with the workflow and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the workflow planning section.";
